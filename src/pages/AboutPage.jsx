            with a unique background in architecture and five years of
            experience crafting user-centered spaces. Recently graduated from
            Ironhack's full-stack web development bootcamp. My goal is to create
            intuitive, efficient, and responsive front-end solutions that

            I believe great user experience emerges at the intersection of
            functionality, simplicity, and style. My experience as an architect
            in Paraguay taught me to think big-picture first, collaborating with
            clients, teams, and suppliers to harmonize diverse needs and
            perspectivesâ€”skills that seamlessly translate to UX/UI and web
            development. Equipped with a Master's in UX/UI from ESDI (Barcelona)
            and a deep desire to solve problems, I'm ready to design and
            implement digital solutions that are not only beautiful but also
            functional and user-centered.
